## Tips for Using This Roadmap

- Consistency: Aim to solve at least one problem a day to build and maintain momentum.
- Understand, Don't Memorize: Focus on understanding the underlying concepts rather than memorizing solutions.
- Reflect: After solving each problem, review your solution and compare it with others to learn different approaches.
- Ask for Help: If you're stuck, don't hesitate to seek hints or explanations to overcome hurdles.
